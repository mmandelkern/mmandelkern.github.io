I argue that 'p or q' can be interpreted as  (<i>p</i>&or;<i>q</i>)&and;
&#9826;<i>p</i>&and;&#9826;<i>q</i>, where &#9826; is a possibility modal whose flavor can be epistemic, circumstantial, or deontic. I show that no extant theory can account for this generalization, and argue that the best way to do so is with a direct theory on which 'or' means &lambda;<i>p</i>.&lambda;<i>q</i>.(<i>p</i>&or;<i>q</i>)&and;
&#9826;<i>p</i>&and;&#9826;<i>q</i>. I show that the resulting theory also yields an appealing account of both wide- and narrow-scope free choice inferences.

In the course of proving a tenability result about the probabilities of conditionals, van Fraassen (1976) introduced a semantics for conditionals based on &omega;-sequences of worlds, which amounts to a particularly simple special case of ordering semantics for conditionals. On that semantics, 'If p, then q' is true at an &omega;-sequence just in case q is true at the first tail of the sequence where p is true (if such a tail exists). This approach has become increasingly popular in recent years. However, its logic has never been explored. We axiomatize the logic of &omega;-sequence semantics, showing that it is the result of adding two new axioms to Stalnaker's logic C2: one, Flattening, which is prima facie attractive, and, and a second, Sequentiality, which is complex and difficult to assess. We also show that when sequence semantics is generalized to arbitrary (transfinite) ordinal sequences, the result is the logic that adds only Flattening to C2. We also explore the logics of a few other interesting restrictions of ordinal sequence semantics, and explore whether sequence semantics is motivated by probabilistic considerations, answering, pace van Fraassen, in the negative.

Epistemic modals have peculiar logical features that are challenging to account for in a broadly
classical framework. For instance, while a sentence of the form   p&#8743;&#9826;&not;p  ('p, but it might be that
not p') appears to be a contradiction,   &#9826;&not;p  does not entail   &not;p, which would follow in classical logic.
Likewise, the classical laws of distributivity and disjunctive syllogism fail for epistemic modals. Existing
attempts to account for these facts generally either under- or over-correct. Some theories predict that
  p&#8743;&#9826;&not;p, a so-called epistemic contradiction, is a contradiction only in an etiolated sense, under a notion of
entailment that does not allow substitution of logical equivalents; these theories underpredict the infelicity
of embedded epistemic contradictions. Other theories savage classical logic, eliminating not just rules that
intuitively fail, like distributivity and disjunctive syllogism, but also rules like non-contradiction, excluded
middle, De Morgan's laws, and disjunction introduction, which intuitively remain valid for epistemic
modals. In this paper, we aim for a middle ground, developing a semantics and logic for epistemic
modals that makes epistemic contradictions genuine contradictions and that invalidates distributivity
and disjunctive syllogism but that otherwise preserves classical laws that intuitively remain valid. We
start with an algebraic semantics, based on ortholattices instead of Boolean algebras, and then propose a
more concrete possibility semantics, based on partial possibilities related by compatibility. Both semantics
yield the same consequence relation, which we axiomatize. Then we show how to extend our semantics
to explain parallel phenomena involving probabilities and conditionals. The goal throughout is to retain
what is desirable about classical logic while accounting for the non-classicality of epistemic vocabulary.

This paper is about   guessing : how people respond to a question when they aren't certain of the answer. Guesses show surprising and systematic patterns that the most obvious theories don't explain. We argue that these patterns reveal that people aim to optimize a tradeoff between accuracy and informativity when forming their guess. After spelling out our theory, we use it to argue that guessing plays a central role in our cognitive lives. In particular, our account of guessing yields new theories of belief, assertion, and the conjunction fallacy---the psychological finding that people sometimes rank a conjunction as more probable than one of its conjuncts. More generally, we suggest that guessing helps explain how boundedly rational agents like us navigate a complex, uncertain world.

The meaning of definite descriptions is a central topic in philosophy and linguistics. Indefinites have been relatively neglected by philosophers, under the Russellian as- sumption that they are simply existential quantifiers. However, a well-known set of patterns suggest that this assumption is wrong. In this paper I develop a new approach to (in)definites which aims to capture these patterns. On my theory, truth-conditions are classical. But in addition to truth-conditions, meanings comprise a second dimension, which I call bounds. It is at the level of bounds, not truth-conditions, that the characteristic coordination between indefinites and definites takes place. My system has a classical logic, thus avoiding serious problems which face the most plausible extant account of these patterns, namely, dynamic semantics. More generally, my approach yields a new perspective on the relation between truth-conditions and dynamic effects in natural language.

Recent work has argued that belief is weak: the level of rational credence required for belief is relatively low. That literature has contrasted belief with assertion, arguing that the latter requires an epistemic state much stronger than (weak) belief---perhaps knowledge or even certainty. We argue that this is wrong: assertion is just as weak as belief. We first present a variety of new arguments for this claim, and then show that the standard arguments for stronger norms are not convincing. Finally, we sketch an alternative picture on which the fundamental norm of assertion is to say what you believe, but both belief and assertion are weak. To help make sense of this, we propose that both belief and assertion involve navigating a tradeoff between accuracy and informativity: it can makes sense to believe or say something you only have weak evidence for, so long as it's sufficiently informative.

The   Identity  principle says that conditionals with the form 'If p, then p' are logical truths. 
  Identity  is overwhelmingly plausible, and has rarely been explicitly challenged. 
But a wide range of conditionals nonetheless invalidate it. 
I explain the problem, and argue that the culprit is the principle known as   Import-Export, which we must thus reject. 
I then explore how we can reject   Import-Export  in a way that still makes sense of the intuitions that support it, arguing that the differences between indicative and subjunctive conditionals play a key role in solving this puzzle.

I discuss what I call   practical Moore sentences :
 sentences like 'You must close your door, but I don't know whether you will',
  which combine a command with an admission that the speaker does not know whether she will be obeyed. 
  Practical Moore sentences are infelicitous. 
  I argue that this infelicity is quite surprising: 
  intuitively, there should be nothing wrong with giving someone an order while acknowledging that you do not know whether it will obeyed. 
  I argue that this infelicity points towards a striking fact about human psychology: 
  when giving an order, we must act as if we believe we will be obeyed.

McGee (1985) argued that modus ponens was invalid for the natural language conditional 'If. . . then. . . '. Many subsequent responses have argued that, while McGee's examples show that modus ponens fails to preserve truth, they do not show that modus ponens fails to preserve rational full acceptance, and thus modus ponens may still be valid in the latter informational sense. I show that when we turn our attention from indicative conditionals (the focus of most of the literature to date) to subjunctive conditionals, we find that modus ponens does not preserve either truth or rational full acceptance, and thus is not valid in either sense. In concluding I briefly consider how we can account for these facts.

We argue that definite noun phrases give rise to uniqueness inferences characterized by a pattern we call   definiteness projection. 
Definiteness projection says that the uniqueness inference of a definite projects out unless there is an indefinite antecedent in a position that filters presuppositions. 
We argue that definiteness projection poses a serious puzzle for e-type theories of (in)definites; on such theories, 
indefinites should filter existence presuppositions but not uniqueness presuppositions.
 We argue that definiteness projection also poses challenges for dynamic approaches, 
 which have trouble generating uniqueness inferences and predicting some filtering behavior, 
 though unlike the challenge for e-type theories, these challenges have mostly been noted in the literature, 
 albeit in a piecemeal way. Our central aim, however, is not to argue for or against a particular view, but rather to formulate and motivate a generalization about definiteness which any adequate theory must account for.

		In a brief discussion of epistemic modals, Wittgenstein (1953) warns against &lsquo;regard[ing] a hesitant assertion as an assertion of hesitancy&rsquo;. 
		
	A modal claim like &lsquo;It might be raining&rsquo;, the thought goes, should not be regarded as an assertion of the speaker's uncertainty as to whether or not it is raining, 
	but rather as something quite different in kind: 
	a proposal to treat the possibility of rain as live. 
	Wittgenstein&rsquo;s admonition has, in recent years, been at the heart of arguments that, in order to make sense of the dynamics of epistemic modal claims, 
	we must reject the contextualist framework for analyzing communication&mdash;a framework on which assertions of epistemic modal claims, like all assertions, convey information. 
	In this paper, I argue that, on the contrary, taking Wittgenstein's admonition seriously does not require abandoning the contextualist framework: 
	we can capture the fundamental dynamics of epistemic modality within the contextualist framework, provided we take the assertoric content of unembedded epistemic modal claims 
	to be determined by the prospective common attitudes of the conversants in question.

I explore the logic of the conditional, using credence judgments to argue against   Duality  and in favor of   Conditional Excluded Middle.
 I then explore how to give a theory of the conditional which validates the latter and not the former, developing a variant on Kratzer (1981)'s restrictor theory, 
 as well as a proposal which combines Stalnaker (1968)'s theory of the conditional with the theory of epistemic modals I develop in Mandelkern 2019a. 
 I argue that the latter approach fits naturally with a conception of conditionals as referential devices which allow us to talk about particular worlds.

There is a difference between the conditions in which one can felicitously use a 'must'-claim like (1-a) and those in which one can use the corresponding claim without the 'must', as in (1-b):
<br><br>

(1) a. It must be raining out.<br> b. It is raining out.<br><br>

It is difficult to pin down just what this difference amounts to. 
And it is difficult to account for this difference, since assertions of 'Must p' and assertions of p alone seem to have the same basic goal: 
namely, communicating that p is true. 
In this paper I give a new account of the conversational role of 'must'.
 I begin by arguing that a 'must'-claim is felicitous only if there is a shared argument for the proposition it embeds.
  I then argue that this generalization, which I call   Support, can explain the more familiar generalization that 'must'-claims are felicitous only if the speaker's evidence for them is in some sense indirect. 
  Finally, I propose a pragmatic derivation of   Support  as a manner implicature.

What does 'might' mean?
One hypothesis is that 'It might be raining' is essentially an avowal of ignorance like 'For all I know, it's raining'. 
But it turns out these two constructions embed in different ways, in particular as parts of larger constructions like Wittgenstein's 'It might be raining and it's not' and Moore's 'It's raining and I don't know it', respectively.
 A variety of approaches have been developed to account for those differences. 
 All approaches agree that both Moore sentences and Wittgenstein sentences are classically consistent. 
 In this paper I argue against this consensus. 
 I adduce a variety of new data which I argue can best be accounted for if we treat Wittgenstein sentences as being classically inconsistent. 
 This creates a puzzle, since there is decisive reason to think that 'Might p'  is classically consistent with 'Not p'. 
 How can it also be that 'Might p and not p' and 'Not p and might p' are classically inconsistent? 
 To make sense of this situation, I propose a new theory of epistemic modals and their interaction with embedding operators. 
 This account makes sense of the subtle embedding behavior of epistemic modals, shedding new light on their meaning and, more broadly, the dynamics of information in natural language.

We propose a new analysis of a class of modals which we call   agentive modals : ability modals and their duals, compulsion modals. After criticizing existing approaches - the existential quantificational analysis, the universal quantificational analysis, and the conditional analysis - we lay out a new account that builds on both the existential and conditional analyses. On our account, a sentence like &lsquo;John can swim across the river&rsquo; says that there is some   practically available action  (in a sense we make precise) which is such that, if John tries to do it, he swims across the river. We argue that this approach avoids the problems faced by existing accounts of agentive modality, and show how it can be extended to an account of generic agentive modal claims. The upshot is a new vantage point on the role of agentive modal ascriptions in practical discourse: ability ascriptions serve as a kind of hypothetical guarantee, on our account, and compulsion ascriptions as a kind of non-hypothetical guarantee.

I first briefly review a cluster of problems - known collectively as the   proviso problem  - for most extant theories of presupposition, arguing that the main pragmatic response to them faces a serious challenge. I avoid these problems by adopting two changes in perspective on presupposition. First, I propose a theory of projection according to which presuppositions project unless they are locally entailed. Second, I reject the standard assumption that presuppositions are contents which must be entailed by the input context; instead, I propose that presuppositions are contents which are marked as backgrounded. I show that, together, these commitments allow us to avoid the proviso problem altogether, and generally make plausible predictions about presupposition projection out of connectives and attitude predicates. I close by sketching a two-dimensional implementation of my theory which allows us to make further welcome predictions about attitude predicates and quantifiers.

<ul type=none Style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><li>The Proviso Problem is the discrepancy between the predictions of nearly every major theory of semantic presupposition about what is semantically presupposed by conditionals, disjunctions, and conjunctions, versus observations about what speakers of certain sentences are felt to be presupposing. I argue that the Proviso Problem is a more serious problem than has been recognized in much of the current literature. After briefly describing the problem and two standard responses to it, I give a number of examples which, I argue, show that those responses are inadequate. I conclude by briefly exploring alternate approaches to presupposition that avoid this problem.
